# BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at National Institutes of Mental Health. I completed my PhD under Marlene Behrmann at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018, and received my MPhil and BSocSc (First Class Honors) from University of Hong Kong in 2013 and 2011, respectively.
