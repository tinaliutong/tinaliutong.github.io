## WRITING FOR THE PUBLIC
In 2015, I began writing about cognitive psychology and the brain for the public on Zhihu, which was then a Chinese question-and-answer website similar to Quora in English but has recently become Zhihu Inc. (NASDAQ: ZH). 
To date, my popular science blog has attracted over 115,000 followers, 38,000 likes, 45,000 favorites, and 7 professional endorsements. Moreover, Zhihu Editor's Picks, Zhihu Roundtable, and Zhihu Daily have featured 25 of my answers and 10 of my articles. In recognition of my contributions to the fields of Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience, and Psychology on Zhihu, I have been awarded the title of "Outstanding Respondent."
I occasionally use the pen name "This is Not Tina" for my writing, while at other times I use my real name, 劉彤.

A. My ongoing collaborations with editors at Zhihu.

A1. eBook (2017): [Imposter Syndrome「亚优秀症候群」](https://www.zhihu.com/pub/book/19551075)

		It's a bummer that the impact score has worsened slightly,
		despite the inclusion of a new high-impact publication, 
		the incorporation of new preliminary data, 
		and the addition of a clinical co-mentor to address the concerns from the previous round.
		C'est la vie!
		
2021		Initial Submission, NIMH Pathway to Independence Awards (K99/R00) 
		"Linking emotional processing and neural activity through layer-specific fMRI, MEG, and neurofeedback"
		Impact Score: 33 
		It's a borderline score according to the Program Officer, 
		so I pressed on with revision and resubmission.
