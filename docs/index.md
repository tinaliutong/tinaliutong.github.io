## WRITING FOR THE PUBLIC
In 2015, I began writing about cognitive psychology and the brain for the public on Zhihu, which was then a Chinese question-and-answer website similar to Quora in English but has recently become Zhihu Inc. (NASDAQ: ZH). 

To date, my popular science blog has received more than 38,000 likes, 45,000 favorites, and 7 professional endorsements. Moreover, Zhihu Editor's Picks, Zhihu Roundtable, and Zhihu Daily have featured 25 of my answers and 10 of my articles. In recognition of my contributions to the fields of Cognitive Psychology, Neuroscience, and Psychology on Zhihu, I have been awarded the title of "Outstanding Respondent."

PS. I occasionally use the pen name "This is Not Tina" for my writing.

A. My ongoing collaborations with editors at Zhihu.

A1. eBook (2017): [Imposter Syndrome「亚优秀症候群」](https://www.zhihu.com/pub/book/19551075)

A2. Live podcast (2018): [How to overcome imposter feelings? 如何停止自我否定，摆脱「骗子综合症」?](https://www.zhihu.com/lives/1035484758083346432)

A3. Zhihu Book Club recommendation in 2018: [Growth mindset「终身成长」](https://www.zhihu.com/remix/instabooks/971821620297498624) <br/>
I suggested the book "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck, published by Random House in 2006. 
Note: This recording does not feature my voice, but instead that of a professional voice actor.

A4. Zhihu Book Club recommendation in 2019: [Emotional Intelligence「情商」](https://www.zhihu.com/remix/instabooks/1087142232628391936) <br/>
I recommended the book "Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ" by Daniel Goleman, published by Bantam Books in 2005.
